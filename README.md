# Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup>
**Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup>**  is a full-stack, integrated hardware-software control platform based on Edge computing technology designed by hardware engineers that can perform at any scale from home automation to particle accelerators.

**Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup>** was developed at the MaxIV Synchrotron Light Source and the European Spallation Source both located in Lund, Sweden. In the world of complex and costly particle accelerators, ***a strong 24/7 maintenance mindset is a must***. It is essential to always understand the state of a machine remotely and to be able to securely troubleshoot it efficiently from anywhere in the world at any time.  

**Thatâ€™s why we developed Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup>**
